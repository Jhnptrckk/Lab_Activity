        while also being a major consumer of fossil fuels. Its natural resources

        one of the largest freshwater systems in the world. The countryâ€™s wildlife is 
        diverse, with iconic species such as bison, bald eagles, and grizzly bears, and it faces 
        environmental challenges like climate change, deforestation, and habitat loss. 
        The U.S. is also known for its agricultural 
        productivity, producing a large portion of the world's grains, fruits, and vegetables.
